# Python Concurrency Examples - GIL Demonstration

This repository contains educational examples demonstrating the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python and how it affects different types of workloads.

## üìö Overview

The Python GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) is a fundamental concept that affects how Python handles multi-threading. This collection of programs demonstrates:

- **Why threading doesn't help CPU-bound tasks** (due to GIL)
- **When threading provides major performance benefits** (I/O-bound tasks)
- **Real-world examples** with benchmarks and explanations

## üöÄ Programs Included

### 1. `seq.py` - Sequential CPU-bound Baseline
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates optimal single-threaded performance for CPU-intensive work
- **Workload**: 50 million decrements in a tight loop
- **Key Learning**: This is the baseline - threading won't improve this!
- **Runtime**: ~0.66s on Apple M3 Pro (much faster than author's original 5s estimate)

### 2. `threaded.py` - Multi-threaded CPU-bound (GIL Impact)
- **Purpose**: Shows why threading doesn't help CPU-bound tasks
- **Tests**: 1, 2, 4, and 8 threads performing the same work
- **Key Learning**: No performance improvement due to GIL serialization
- **Expected Result**: All thread counts take ~0.67s (no speedup)

### 3. `simple_io.py` - Local I/O-bound Threading Demo
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates threading benefits for I/O operations
- **Workload**: 8 simulated file operations (0.5s each)
- **Key Learning**: GIL is released during I/O waits
- **Performance**: ~8x speedup (4.0s ‚Üí 0.5s)

### 4. `io_bound.py` - Real-world Network I/O Comparison
- **Purpose**: Shows threading/async benefits with actual HTTP requests
- **Approaches**: Sequential, Threading, and Async (asyncio)
- **Workload**: 8 HTTP requests with 1-second server delays
- **Performance**: ~5-6x speedup with threading/async

## üî¨ Key Findings

| Task Type | Threading Benefit | Why |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| **CPU-bound** | ‚ùå None (overhead) | GIL prevents parallel execution |
| **I/O-bound** | ‚úÖ Major speedup | GIL released during I/O operations |

## üí° When to Use Each Approach

### Use Threading For:
- File I/O operations
- Network requests (HTTP, database)
- User input waiting
- Any operation that waits for external resources

### Don't Use Threading For:
- Mathematical computations
- Image/data processing
- Tight loops with calculations
- CPU-intensive pure Python code

### Alternatives for CPU-bound Tasks:
- `multiprocessing` (separate processes, no GIL)
- NumPy/SciPy (C extensions that release GIL)
- Cython (compiled extensions)
- PyPy (JIT compiler)

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Examples

```bash
# Run individual examples
python seq.py           # Baseline CPU-bound performance
python threaded.py      # Show GIL impact on CPU tasks
python simple_io.py     # Local I/O threading demo
python io_bound.py      # Real-world network I/O demo

# All examples include detailed output and timing information
```

## üéØ Educational Goals

This repository helps you understand:

1. **The GIL Limitation**: Why CPU-bound Python code doesn't benefit from threading
2. **I/O Concurrency**: How threading dramatically improves I/O-bound performance
3. **Real-world Application**: When to choose threading vs other approaches
4. **Performance Measurement**: How to benchmark and compare different approaches

## üìä Expected Results Summary

- **CPU-bound (seq.py)**: ~0.66s baseline
- **CPU-bound threaded**: ~0.67s (no improvement)
- **I/O-bound sequential**: ~4-8s (slow)
- **I/O-bound threaded**: ~0.5-2s (much faster!)

## ü§î Why Such Fast Performance?

The original author estimated 5 seconds for the CPU-bound task, but modern hardware (like Apple M3 Pro) runs it in ~0.66s due to:

- **Superior CPU performance** (modern architecture)
- **Python optimizations** (version 3.12.10 improvements)
- **System efficiency** (optimized OS and hardware)

This 7.5x performance difference demonstrates how hardware and software improvements compound over time!
